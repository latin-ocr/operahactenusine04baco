THE present fascicule contains the completion of the Mazarine MS.
of the Communia Naturalium. Fasc. V will include the remainder of
Bacon’s Naturalia. As my first aim is to give as faithful a transcript
of what the manuscripts say as possible, Ι shall hope to be excused
for giving this book the title Ι found in the manuscript I am printing,
however well-founded the objections to it are.

Professor Little's promised publication of the missing portion of
the Opus Tertium and the fact that his MS. does not contain the
‘ de celestibus ' (pp. 419-41) relieves me of the necessity of examining
in detail Professor Duhem’s conJectural reconstruction of that work.
1 am, personally, convinced that there must have been at least two
forms of the work prepared, if existing manuscripts are to be trusted.
Parts I and II of this book were at one time included in the Compendz'um
th'losoplzz'e (see pp. 316, 342): several chapters of Part V coincide to
some extent with the Opus Tertium MS. of M. Duhem (see pp. 419-41),
chapter 18 being found in the Compendz'um philosophie diff. 4
(cited as S).

For Parts 1-111 (pp. 309—84) we have in addition to the Mazarine
MS. a very good text in Digby 76 (cited as O), which has been suc-
cessively the property of Leland‚ John Dee (‘ 1556, May 18, Londini‚
emi ex bibliotheca Lelandi'), and Sir Kenelm Digby. We have no
other text for Parts IV or V, though some help is obtained by the parallel
passages in the Opus lllajus and Terlz'um‚ or in the Compendz‘um Philo-
sophz‘e above referred to. I have to renew my thanks to Mr. Herbert‚
Mr. Bywater‚ and the Clarendon Press for most valuable assistance.
